**Project Title:** Color Switch Game  
**Engine Used:** Unity  
**Programming Language:** C# (Visual Studio)

**Overview:**  
This project is a mobile-style game inspired by the popular "Color Switch" game, developed using **Unity** and **C#** through **Visual Studio**. The game is centered around controlling a ball that must pass through various colored obstacles. The challenge is that the ball can only pass through obstacles of the same color, and the player must switch the ball's color by tapping the screen to match the obstacle's color.

**Key Features:**
- **Color Change Mechanism:** Players tap the screen to change the ball's color, allowing it to pass through matching colored obstacles.
- **Endless Gameplay:** The game is built with an endless mode, where the difficulty gradually increases as the player progresses.
- **Obstacles:** The game includes a variety of obstacle types, such as rotating barriers, moving platforms, and stationary color barriers.
- **Scoring System:** Players earn points based on how many obstacles they successfully pass through.
- **Progression:** As players progress, the game introduces new difficulty elements like faster obstacles and more frequent color changes.

**Technical Features:**
- **Game Mechanics & Physics:** The core mechanics include smooth character movement, color detection, and collision detection. Unity's 2D physics system was used to manage the ball's interactions with obstacles.
- **UI and Sound:** Basic UI elements like score counters, buttons, and splash screens were designed. Sound effects were integrated for actions like color switching, collision, and scoring.
- **Endless Mode:** Procedurally generated levels using randomization to create dynamic gameplay.
- **Touch Input:** The game is designed for mobile devices and responds to screen touches for gameplay interaction (color switching).

**Development Process:**
1. **Conceptualization:** The game idea and mechanics were outlined, taking inspiration from the original "Color Switch" game.
2. **Designing the Ball and Obstacles:** Unity's 2D sprites were used to create the ball, obstacles, and environment.
3. **Programming Core Features:** C# scripts were written in Visual Studio to control the game flow, including the color switching, ball movement, scoring system, and level generation.
4. **Testing and Debugging:** Extensive testing was done to ensure smooth performance across different mobile devices and to fine-tune the gameplay mechanics for a challenging but fair experience.
5. **Optimization:** Ensured the game ran efficiently on lower-end mobile devices, optimizing assets, and reducing unnecessary computations.

**Outcome:**  
The project successfully created a functional Color Switch game with dynamic and increasingly difficult levels. It is fully playable, with intuitive controls and engaging gameplay that keeps players challenged as they progress through increasingly difficult levels.

**Future Improvements:**  
- **Leaderboards** and online scoring system integration.
- **Power-ups and Special Features** (e.g., temporary invincibility, slower obstacles).
- **Additional Levels and Obstacles** to add variety and keep the gameplay fresh.
- **Polished Audio and Visuals** for a more immersive experience.
